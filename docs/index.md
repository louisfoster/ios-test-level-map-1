## HI! ðŸ‘‹

After spending a bit of time playing around with SceneKit (in [this project](https://louisfoster.github.io/ubiquitous-succotash/)) and encountering a few issues regarding planning the individual parts of the "game," I decided I wanted to do a series where I attempt to build the various individual systems to see what is involved and how they related to other parts of the whole system.

This one is for creating a "level" or "world", as in the environment in which the avatar/player/character/story exists. This version is pretty basic but I intend to iterate on this.
